        <p>10. Governing law and choice of forum</p>
        <p>10.1. These Terms of Use are governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to conflict of law principles. Pursuant to Section 10 hereunder, which provides that disputes are to be resolved through binding arbitration or small claims court, to the extent that any lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted hereunder, the User and this site agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within Los Angeles County, California, for the purpose of litigating all such disputes.</p>
        <p>10.2. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and this site in the most expedient and cost-effective manner, you and this site agree to resolve disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction (“Agreement to Arbitrate”).</p>
        <p>10.3. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Any arbitration under these Terms of Use will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. You acknowledge and agree that the arbitrator may award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that individual party’s claim(s). Any relief awarded cannot affect other users.</p>
        <p>10.4. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND this site ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>
        <p>10.5. You and this site agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to: claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory; claims that arose before this or any prior Terms of Use. Claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms of Use.</p>
        <p>10.6. Notwithstanding Section 10, you and this site agree that no statement herein shall be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either party’s right to:</p>
        <p>10.6.1. bring an individual action in small claims court;</p>
        <p>10.6.2. pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available;</p>
        <p>10.6.3. seek injunctive relief in any competent court of law; or</p>
        <p>10.6.4. to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.</p>
        <p>10.7. Any arbitration between you and this site will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting this site.</p>
        <p>10.8. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to this site should be addressed to: 5470 Frazier Lake Rd, Gilroy, CA 95020 (“Notice Address”).</p>
        <p>10.9. The Notice must:</p>
        <p>10.9.1. describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and</p>
        <p>10.9.2. set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). If the User and this site do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, User or this site may commence an arbitration proceeding.</p>
        <p>10.10. In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, this site will, at your request, reimburse you for your payment of the arbitration filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules. Any request for payment of fees by this site should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and this site will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), you agree to reimburse this site for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by this site on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA’s rules.</p>
        <p>10.11. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. Any in-person arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Los Angeles County, California. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</p>
        <p>10.12. Unless both you and this site agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>
        <p>11. Miscellaneous</p>
        <p>11.1. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Terms of Use shall not affect the validity of this Terms of Use as a whole and any such provision shall be enforced, and reconstructed if need be in a way that best embodies the intent of this Terms of Use, to apply to the maximum extent allowable under applicable law.</p>
        <p>11.2. This Terms of Use may not be modified, supplemented, qualified, or interpreted by any trade usage or prior course of dealing not made a part of the Terms of Use by its express terms. The failure by either party to enforce at any time any of the provisions of this Terms of Use, to exercise any election or option provided herein, or to require at any time the performance of the other of any of the provisions herein will not in any way be construed as a waiver of such provisions. Any claim or dispute between us must be brought within one (1) year after the cause of action arises, or such claim or cause of action is barred. Reasonable attorneys' fees and costs will be awarded to the prevailing party in the event of litigation involving the enforcement or interpretation of this Terms of Use. The section headings used herein are for convenience only and shall not be given any legal import.</p>
